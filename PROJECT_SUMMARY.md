# Block Puzzle Game - Project Summary

## Overview
This project is a web-based Block Puzzle game, implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on mobile devices. The game is designed to mimic popular Block Puzzle mobile apps, where players drag different shaped blocks onto a grid, trying to complete rows and columns to clear them and earn points.

## Current State of the Project

### Core Game Features
- **Grid-based gameplay**: 10x10 grid where players place blocks
- **Block shapes**: Multiple block shapes (Tetris-like and custom shapes)
- **Next pieces**: Three randomly generated pieces for the player to choose from
- **Scoring system**: Points awarded based on the number of blocks in a piece and bonus points for clearing multiple lines at once
- **Game over detection**: Game ends when no more valid moves are available
- **Line clearing**: Completed rows and columns are cleared without shifting other blocks (unlike Tetris)

### User Interaction
- **Drag-and-drop**: Players can drag pieces directly from the selection area to the grid
- **Touch optimization**: Enhanced for mobile devices with proper touch offset handling
- **Finger obstruction prevention**: Preview appears above the user's finger during placement
- **Visual feedback**: Pieces snap to valid grid positions with highlighting
- **Cross-platform interaction**: Works with both touch and mouse inputs

### Visual Design
- **Block styling**: Blocks have 3D effect with highlights and shadows
- **Color scheme**: Distinct, high-contrast colors for different block shapes
- **Responsive layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Visual indicators**: Valid placements are highlighted in green

### PWA Implementation
- **Installable**: Can be added to home screen on iOS and Android devices
- **Offline support**: Service worker caches assets for offline play
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **iOS optimization**: Custom meta tags and icons for iOS devices

## Implementation Details

### Key Files
- **index.html**: Main HTML structure with PWA configuration
- **css/styles.css**: Styling for the game and UI elements
- **js/game.js**: Core game logic and rendering
- **js/pwa.js**: PWA service worker registration
- **service-worker.js**: Cache management for offline capability
- **manifest.json**: PWA manifest for installation and theming
- **assets/**: Directory containing icons and splash screens

### Key Technical Components

#### Game Engine (game.js)
- **Game class**: Main class that handles game logic, rendering, and user interaction
- **Grid management**: 2D array representing the game state
- **Piece generation**: Random piece generation and selection mechanics
- **Drag handling**: Complex touch and mouse event handling
- **Collision detection**: Logic to determine valid placements
- **Line clearing**: Algorithm to detect and clear completed lines
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based rendering with visual effects

#### PWA Features
- **Service worker**: Caches game assets for offline play
- **Web app manifest**: Configures how the game appears when installed
- **iOS support**: Specific meta tags and icons for iOS installation

## Recent Changes and Fixes
1. **Line clearing behavior**: Modified to clear completed lines without shifting other blocks
2. **Touch interaction**: Improved to prevent finger obstruction and provide better visual feedback
3. **Drag-and-drop**: Enhanced to allow direct dragging from the selection area to the grid
4. **Score calculation**: Updated to award points based on the number of blocks placed
5. **Color contrast**: Improved with more vibrant, distinguishable colors
6. **iOS installation**: Added specific meta tags and icons for better iOS compatibility

## Future Improvements and Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **High score system**: Add local storage for persisting high scores
- **Sound effects**: Add audio feedback for actions like placing blocks and clearing lines
- **Animations**: Enhance visual feedback with animations for line clearing and game over
- **Difficulty levels**: Implement increasing difficulty or different game modes
- **Tutorial**: Add an interactive tutorial for first-time players
- **Themes**: Allow players to choose different color themes or block styles
- **Social sharing**: Add ability to share scores on social media

### Technical Debt and Optimization
- **Code organization**: Refactor code for better separation of concerns
- **Performance optimization**: Optimize rendering and event handling for smoother gameplay
- **Asset optimization**: Ensure all assets are properly sized and optimized
- **Browser compatibility**: Test and fix issues across different browsers and devices
- **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard controls and screen reader support

## Development Environment
- **Server**: Simple HTTP server (python -m http.server 8000)
- **Deployment**: Files are currently located in the `/site` directory
- **Testing**: Manual testing on different devices (desktop and mobile)
